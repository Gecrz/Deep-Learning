This project aims to use deep learning recurrent neural networks to model bitcoin closing prices. One model will use the FNG indicators to predict the closing price while the second model will use a window of closing prices to predict the nth closing price.

We will need to:

1. [Prepare the data for training and testing](#prepare-the-data-for-training-and-testing)
2. [Build and train custom LSTM RNNs](#build-and-train-custom-lstm-rnns)
3. [Evaluate the performance of each model](#evaluate-the-performance-of-each-model)
